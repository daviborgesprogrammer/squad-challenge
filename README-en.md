# Squad Brasil Challenge
**Film Ratings Search on OMDB**

For this challenge you will have to consume the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and present the result in a list meeting the following criteria:

[ ] Each cell must have the image, name and rating of the film
[ ] When selecting a cell, a detail screen should open with the image, name, rating, and synopsis of the film
[ ] When selecting the movie image on the detail screen, the image must open in fullscreen
[ ] The first screen must have a search field that filters the list
[ ] The API can be called with a free key created on the website itself

Feel free to choose architecture, libs, layout and tests.
